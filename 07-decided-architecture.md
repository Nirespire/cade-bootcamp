# System Architecture

So after looking through our 3 Tiers and talking with those who we trust, here is what we settled on. 

* Database
  * Postgres
* Backend
  * Language: Spring Boot 2.0
  * Platform: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Frontend
  * React

This is a great stack. This will give you tons of flexibility. Spring Boot has lots of features to get started quickly and a large community to help. As a side note, I've picked up GOLang in the last 6 months, and if you are looking for something that is the polar opposite of Spring Boot, then GOLang is: light, fast, clean, and completely devoid of "magic". So if you want something different than Java and Spring, give it a try.
