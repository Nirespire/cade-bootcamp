# Frontend

The "Frontend" generally refers to the browser, but not always. For the sake of this discussion, we will talk about the frontend as the browser. 

On the browser, the battle of choices has been won:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

So the only real question is if you will use a library or framework:
* React 
* Angular
* jQuery
* None (just code in plain HTML / CSS / JavaScript)


This has created tons of flame wars online about which is better. I am currently a fan of React, but I'm sure it will be replaced at some point by a new "cool kid".  Just like every other library in the history of the world. :D
